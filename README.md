# 100 projects

I got the idea for this from [Jess](https://github.com/jessabean/100-javascript-projects), so let's see what sort of trouble I can get into, now! :tada:


## projects

1. [eff-to-cee](https://github.com/dotsara/eff-to-cee): °F → °C
2. [css-star-ratings](https://github.com/dotsara/css-star-ratings): &#9734; → &#9733;
3. [Dick's Drive-In Calculator](https://github.com/dotsara/ddi-calc): :hamburger: :fries: :moneybag:
4. [My First Node.js Server](https://github.com/dotsara/my-first-node-js-server): woo! suggested by @kennymeyers


## contributions

If you'd like to suggest a project (or projects!) for me to work on, [open an issue and suggest away](../../issues)! :grinning:

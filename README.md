# Playtime! ðŸŽ³ / Drills ðŸ“‹

One of the ways that I learn best is by playing around with things and then also by doing drills (I still swim drills in the pool, for example). 

So, that is what I am going to do on this branch!

* How many rides have I taken?

   As of now, there's no ride count available on SoulCycle. You just have to scroll your ride history and count individually. That's prone to miscounting, so I opened the browser Console and started trying things. This definitely wants refactoring, but it got me there, so. !
   
   ```
   let myRides = document.getElementsByClassName("bike-number");
   // copy the values into an Array
   let myBikes = Object.values(myRides)
   // filter the Array by the presence of the word "bike"
   const ridesTaken = myBikes.filter(bike => bike.innerText.includes('bike'));
   ridesTaken.length
   ```
